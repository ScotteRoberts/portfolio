        I am an avid gamer, beach goer, and internet consumer. Gaming is a core
        focus and has been for as long as I remember. The games are not just
        video-based. I love all games and treat life as the ultimate game.

        Like many of my friends, family, and colleages, the internet has molded
        my knowledge of the world (it is difficult to imagine a world now
        without it). My goal is to contribute my knowledge to make a happy,
        healthy internet environment for all to learn from and embrace.

        My personal hobby is tapping (drums, bongos, cajons, cowbells) and if I
        can get my hands on it, it&apos;s going to make some noise.
