## Technology

Gatsby is great. A couple things that most developers will look for when getting into new technologies are its community following and documentations. Since ReactJs is booming right now, Gatsby is gaining popularity as a static site generator. Secondly, Gatsby's documentation is outstanding and visually appealing. Check out their [docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/).

I am using Gatsby to convert my professional portfolio that we started at the beginning of training. Luckily, the coversion process from html / css only code to React isn't too difficult with [stateless functional components](https://medium.com/groww-engineering/stateless-component-vs-pure-component-d2af88a1200b).

> Stateless component declared as a function that has no state and returns the same markup given the same props.

```JavaScript
const Hello = () => {
  return <h1>Hello</h1>;
}
```

These blog posts are all written in markdown originally. However, I had no idea how to translate markdown files into HTML pages. My description of the process was "it's magic". I had no idea what the block box static site generator was going to do when I fed it those files. Gatsby does a good job in their tutorial explaining each step of the process.

Finally, I was introduced to [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/), an alternative network specification to REST, through [this tutorial](https://www.howtographql.com/basics/1-graphql-is-the-better-rest/) suggested in the Gatsby docs. It highlights its robust quality of getting the exact data needed through one GraphQL endpoint instead of combining / disregarding data from one / several REST endpoints. I would highly recommend checking them out because it is gaining in popularity among popular API providers.

Thank you for reading!
