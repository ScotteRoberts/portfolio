## Talent Path

### Recommendations

#### Devon Marantz

This man is a natural leader. I worked with him on our training project during Talent Path as a Software Engineer; Devon was the product owner and oversaw the products progression as a whole. He consistently proves that he is able to listen to advice and ideas as well as give clear direction toward short-term and long-term goals. Furthermore, his positive attitude makes working with him an absolute breeze. I would gladly work with Devon now or any time in the future and have no doubt that he will accomplish great things.

#### Jonathan Azali

Jonathan is a wonderful coworker and team builder. I worked with him at Talent Path, during our training session, and enjoyed his presence as work. His energy and pursuit of knowledge inspire coworkers to jump on any and all tasks. Being a military man, Jonathan has a natural air of leadership and confidence when he enters the room; that confidence is contagious and motivated me during moments of hesitation. [Enter conclusion]

#### Ervin Mitra

Ervin is the genius behind our out of the box thinking. He can size up a situation and make a creative suggestion where many, including myself, stop and say, "it can't be done". Furthermore, Ervin's funny personality makes him a pleasure to work with. [Enter conclusion]. He enjoys working with problems that has vague and currently unknown solutions.

#### Brock Jameson

Brock is the silent mastermind that ensures his team is moving in the right direction. He speaks with purpose and intelligence making him someone that people respect and value.

#### Kevin Amaryabar

Kevin's wit and humor along with his intelligent design skills making him an invaluable member to any team. Furthermore, Kevin isn't afraid to ask questions and suggest his own ideas when meeting during our standups. I had the pleasure of working with Kevin during our training at Talent Path and would love to work with him in the future.
